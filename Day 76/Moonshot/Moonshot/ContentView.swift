/// Accessibility Review:
/// 1. The image in MissionView is too descriptive in VoiceOver. You probably want to make it decorative.
/// 2. The astronaut buttons have a big pause between the title of the commander and their role. This can be fixed by combining the two and adding a label that says both things. The button hint is already there.
/// 3. The image in AstronautView is also too descriptive, and probably should be decorative.
/// 4. The mission label at the bottom of the AstronautView should be in a group. It would be helpful to know (for anyone, blind or otherwise) that these labels here are supposed to be for the missions this astronaut was on.
/// 5. "Moonshot" is pronounced "moon ðŸ’©" by VoiceOver...
